## 🚀 Week 2 New Features

### ✅ Enhanced Model Architecture
```python
# Week 1: Basic model
model = Sequential([base_model, GlobalAveragePooling2D(), Dense(10)])

# Week 2: Enhanced model
model = Sequential([
    advanced_augmentation,           # 5-layer augmentation  
    base_model,
    GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    Dropout(0.3),                   # Optimized dropout
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),   # NEW: Additional layer
    Dropout(0.2),                   # Additional regularization
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```
